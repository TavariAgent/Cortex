# Cortex Calculator

A revolutionary calculator leveraging XOR dual-state management, parallel computation, and structure-defined assembly for massive speed and flexibility. No rigid PEMDAS—flows around priorities with left-to-right on same levels, dropdown nests, and byte-packing for efficiency.

## Vision
- Compute 100k+ decimals in seconds via parallel parts.
- Open-source math engine for pi, e, trig, roots, polynomials, complex algebra, calculus, sums, limits, and more.
- Modular engines (SymPy, NumPy, etc.) for full math coverage.
- Paradigm: Parallel computation respecting primary levels, priority-flow helpers, and XOR pools.

## Architecture
- **main.py**: Core classes (Structure, XorStringCompiler, Compute, etc.) for tracing, compilation, and execution.
- **abc_engines.py**: Base MathEngine with dunders, parallel helpers, and priority ordering.
- **segment_manager.py**: Manages part orders, dropdown assembly, and structure integration.
- **test_main.py**: Basic validation script.

## Getting Started
1. Run `python test_main.py` for a sample flow.
2. Extend engines for new math ops.
3. Contribute forks for more fields!

## Roadmap
- Fill stubs with library integrations.
- Threaded workers for potency.
- Open-source release when useful.
